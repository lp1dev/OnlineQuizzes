The slapcat utility with -n0 reads that config DB and writes its LDIF representation to STDOUT. By redirecting STDOUT into a file (config.ldif), you obtain a complete dump of cn=config. Other utilities (slapadd, slapindex) are used for imports and indexing, and -n1 refers to the first data database, not the config database.","210.4 Configuring an OpenLDAP server (weight: 4)"
